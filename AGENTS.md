Rules for AI Agents :

* Never forget to make code that follow best pratices, standards and recommended architectures, think SOLID, YAGNI, KISS, DRY, Clean archi, DDD...
* Never forget to commit frequently and follow conventional commit
* You might be working in parrallel with an other agent or human, so take care to only commit your modifications, I will make sure (Julien) that everybody is not conflicting on their work by giving everyone very separate tasks
* To speed up things, only run tests related to what you modified instead of all tests during dev, and before committing you can run all unit tests for example

When you have zero context, start by reading the README.md, docs/* and TODO.md to see where we are on this project, explore code if necessary
